#### Requirements
- The [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) notebooks in the proofs folder allow to easily verify some statements present in the paper's appendices.

- The Matlab code requires [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) along with a suitable SDP solver (e.g., Sedumi, SDPT3, Mosek).

- The Numerical experiements are presented in a [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) notebook, and require several Julia packages listed in the first cell of the notebook.
